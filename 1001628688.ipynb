    "1. Please start the program with the following command: `python3 1001628688.py` (You should not need to install any dependencies other than the base Python 3.7+ interpreter.)\n",

    "**My observations:**\n",
    "- Using the `network_example.txt` file provided from canvas, I observed that 3 iterations were required to reach convergence.\n",
    "- Programming this, I realized that you cannot determine if the network is converged at instance $t$ until time $t+1$. Therefore, I implemented a 'is not converged', 'might be converging', and 'is converging' approach to convergence analysis. (See option 8.)\n",
    "- I also noticed many similarities between the competitive inhibitory activation in biological networks and the winner-take-route minimum-cost competition in DV-routing networks. I will apply lessons learned from this project to my research in deep neural network architecture design. I started researching this and found several interesting papers:\n",
    "  - [Can Information Flows Suggest Targets for Interventions in Neural Circuits?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05299) In this paper, the authors performed 'surgery' on a neural network to reduce its racial bias. This seems related to the dynamic restructuring I observed in DV-routing networks. Of course, the Internet is mostly beyond DV-based routing mechanisms so I should think about how to apply similar techniques from BGP, EGP, and other routing protocols to neural network topology design.\n",
    "  - [Training Competitive Binary Neural Networks from Scratch](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01965) This paper is older than the one above (2018), but it seems seminal on the topic of binary neural networks. The authors claim they have found a way to train a binary neural networks directly (i.e.: without starting from a floating point neural network). This seems very important on the topic of efficient route updates."
